Angular Launchpad provides a starting point to create web applications with Angular.

## Development

Launch an app for local development. By default, available at `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.<br/>
The app will automatically reload after a change to the source files.

```
ng serve -o
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.<br/>
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Deployment Build

Compiles an Angular app for deployment.<br/>
The build files are generated in the `dist/` directory of the project workspace.

#### Development Build

Compilation with development settings.

```
ng build
```

#### Production Build

Compilation with production settings.

```
ng build --prod
```
